# The ODict CLI

The ODict command-line interface (CLI) is a Go program you can execute in any terminal to create, dump, merge, search, and index ODict dictionaries.

The CLI's primary distribution channel is currently through its [Homebrew](homebrew.sh) formula:

```
$ brew tap TheOpenDictionary/odict
$ brew install odict
```
